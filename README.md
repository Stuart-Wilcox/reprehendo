# Reprehendo

### Reprehendo is a web-based application for roommates to connect, coordinate chores, post messages, and provides an easy and convenient way of people looking for roommates to find one another.

### Will soon be available at https://35.182.176.4/ 

Reprehendo runs on the popular node.js platform using the expressjs framework. It uses a sqlite3 database for storage, and a custom implementation of authentication. The front-end relies heavily on bootstrap.
